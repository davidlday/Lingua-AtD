    * Removed tests making calls to the service. Network connectivity and lag are generally unpredictable and caused intermittant failures for cpantesters.

1.121570  2012-06-05 04:30:02 EST
    * Changed default throttle to 2 seconds. Tests failing enough to
      show 1 second is too unstable. (www.cpantesters.org).
    * Minor documentation corrections.

1.121550  2012-06-02 19:41:25 EST
    * Added 32 hex digits to API Key per AtD Documentation
    * Added get_error_count() to Results.
    * Fixes for Bug 77309:
        * Added throttle & last_call properties to AtD. Seems the
          service doesn't like being called less than two seconds apart.
        * Replaced Exceptions with Carp. Exceptions will be implemented
          in a later release.

1.113000  2011-10-26 20:12:33 EST
    * More corrections to 01-sanity-atd.t to prevent false failures
      while testing for LWP exceptions.

1.112980  2011-10-25 12:18:11 EST
    * Finished and corrected documentation.
    * Updated 01-sanity-atd.t to use 500.500.500 as hostname. Prevents
      timout issues from services such as OpenDNS trying to nicely
      resolve bad hostnames.

1.112970  2011-10-23 22:00:00 EST
    * Original release
